Here's an example dataset and code that demonstrates how the **`str_detect`** function in R works:

```{r}
# Load the stringr package, which contains the str_detect function
library(stringr)

# Create a sample dataset
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry")

# Use str_detect to check if each element in the fruits vector contains the letter "a"
has_a <- str_detect(fruits, "a")

# Print the results
has_a

```

This code first loads the **`stringr`** package, which contains the **`str_detect`** function. We then create a sample dataset called **`fruits`** that contains five strings representing different types of fruit.

We then use the **`str_detect`** function to check if each element in the **`fruits`** vector contains the letter "a". The **`str_detect`** function takes two arguments: the first is the vector of strings to search, and the second is the pattern to search for. In this case, we use the pattern **`"a"`**, which matches any string that contains the letter "a".

The result of the **`str_detect`** function is a logical vector indicating whether each element in the **`fruits`** vector contains the pattern. In this case, the **`has_a`** vector contains the values **`TRUE`**, **`TRUE`**, **`TRUE`**, **`TRUE`**, and **`FALSE`**, because the first four elements of **`fruits`** contain the letter "a" and the last element does not.

You can also use regular expressions to search for more complex patterns using **`str_detect`**. For example, if you wanted to find all fruits that start with the letter "a" or "b", you could use the following code:

```{r}
# Use str_detect to check if each element in the fruits vector starts with "a" or "b"
starts_with_a_or_b <- str_detect(fruits, "^(a|b)")

# Print the results
starts_with_a_or_b

```

In this case, we use the regular expression **`"^(a|b)"`**, which matches any string that starts with either the letter "a" or the letter "b". The resulting **`starts_with_a_or_b`** vector contains the values **`TRUE`**, **`TRUE`**, **`FALSE`**, **`FALSE`**, and **`FALSE`**, because the first two elements of **`fruits`** start with either "a" or "b" and the remaining elements do not.
