**How to read multiple sheets in an Excel spreadsheet in one go!**

```{r}
library(readxl)

# Define the Excel file path
excel_file <- "testfile.xlsx"

# Get the sheet names
sheet_names <- excel_sheets(excel_file)

# Create an empty list to store the data frames
df_list <- list()

# Loop through the sheet names and read each sheet into a data frame
for (sheet in sheet_names) {
  df_list[[sheet]] <- read_excel(excel_file, sheet = sheet)
}

# Access the data frames by sheet name
df1 <- df_list[[sheet_names[1]]]
df2 <- df_list[[sheet_names[2]]]

```

In this example, we first load the "readxl" package and define the path to the Excel file. We then use the **`excel_sheets()`** function to get the names of all the sheets in the file. Next, we create an empty list to store the data frames and use a **`for`** loop to read each sheet into a data frame and add it to the list using the sheet name as a key. Finally, we can access the data frames from the list by sheet name.
