The **`map2()`** function in the **`purrr`** package of R is used to apply a function to elements of two or more vectors or lists in a pairwise fashion. It iterates over the corresponding elements of the input vectors/lists and returns a new list with the output of applying the specified function to each pair of elements.

The basic syntax for **`map2()`** is as follows:

```{r}
#map2(.x, .y, .f, ...)

```

where:

-   **`.x`**, **`.y`**: input vectors or lists to iterate over.

-   **`.f`**: function to apply to each pair of elements from **`.x`** and **`.y`**. This can be a function name or a lambda function defined inline with the formula syntax (**`~`**).

-   **`...`**: additional arguments to pass to **`.f`**.

For example, let's say we have two vectors **`x`** and **`y`** containing numbers, and we want to calculate the sum of the corresponding elements. We can use **`map2()`** as follows:

```{r}
library(purrr)

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)

sums <- map2(x, y, ~ .x + .y)

sums
# Output: [1] 5 7 9

```

Here, the lambda function **`~ .x + .y`** takes two arguments (**`.x`** and **`.y`**) and returns their sum. **`map2()`** applies this function to each pair of elements from **`x`** and **`y`**, and returns a list with the sums.
